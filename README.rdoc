== README
1) To set up Postgres include in the Gemfile the following line:
    gem 'pg', '0.17.0'
2) Create a 'ruby_user' account in Postgres

3) Log into postgres and create a database with the line:
    CREATE DATABASE trio_dev;
4) Install Postgres and set the owner of the database to be ruby_user by running the line:
    ALTER DATABASE trio_dev OWNER TO ruby_user;

== ANNOTATIONS
Annotations were used to keep track of what issues that need to be fixed, updated....basically a TODO list after everything is said and done.  

= RUBY ANNOTATION
To get a list of the default ruby annotations, run the following in the terminal:
rake notes

= CUSTOM ANNOTATION
The following custom annotations were used:
JAVASCRIPT_TEST - Used to denote where we need to test for AJAX/Javascript behavior
DUPLICATION_UPDATE - Noted where duplication in code, namely because of difference in languages (Javascript constants and Ruby Constants)

To get a list of the custom annotations in the project that I used run the following command in the terminal:
rake notes:custom ANNOTATION=JAVASCRIPT_TEST

= Resque
Installation
